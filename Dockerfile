# Both bases are pinned by digest so a build is reproducible and the image that
# was scanned is the image that ships. The build stage never reaches the final
# image, so its CVEs do not ship; the runtime base is what the scan gate guards.
# Bump by replacing tag AND digest together (dependabot does this for you).

# `-slim` carries nginx + its core modules only: no image-filter / xslt modules and
# therefore no libpng / tiff / libxml2 / curl, which were most of the CVE surface.
# nginx.conf uses only core directives (gzip, try_files, proxy_pass), so slim suffices.
